Here’s a detailed description of Sparkify, a feature-rich application we've built. Sparkify is a full-stack web application designed to connect users with one another through a combination of swiping functionality, matches, and real-time chat features. Below is a complete overview of the project, from its conceptualization to its implementation.

Project Overview

Sparkify is a social networking application inspired by modern matchmaking platforms. It allows users to create accounts, browse through profiles, express preferences (like or dislike), find matches, and interact through a real-time chat interface. The application includes robust user authentication, a streamlined user interface, and a well-structured backend to handle all functionalities efficiently.

Purpose: Users can create accounts and securely log in to their profiles.

Implementation:

A visually appealing and intuitive login/register page.

Registration: Users can register by providing their details, which are stored securely in the database.

Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.

Validation: Both forms include validation for empty fields, password criteria, and error messages for incorrect login details.

2. Home Page

Purpose: Display profiles of other users, excluding those on which actions (like/dislike) have already been taken.

Features:

Sidebar for navigation across various sections of the app (e.g., Home, Matches, Search, etc.).

Topbar with:

Search bar: Enables users to search for specific profiles.

Profile Icon: A clickable icon for quick access to the current user’s profile.

3. Swipe Page

Purpose: The core feature of Sparkify where users can interact with profile cards.

Features:

Dynamic cards are fetched from the backend, displaying user profiles.

Actions:

Like: Indicates interest in a user. Triggers backend logic to check for mutual matches.

Dislike: Skips the current user profile.

View Profile: Takes users to a detailed profile page of the card being viewed.





---

4. Matches Page

Purpose: Displays profiles of users who have mutually liked each other.

Features:

A grid or list view of matched profiles.

Chat Icon: On each matched user card, a chat icon is available to initiate or continue conversations.

Real-time updates when new matches are formed.




---

5. Profile Page

Purpose: Allows users to view and edit their profile.

Features:

Display user details such as name, bio, interests, and preferences.

Editable fields for updating user information.




---

6. Search Page

Purpose: Enables users to search for other profiles based on preferences.

Features:

Search filters like location, age, or interests.

A list of filtered users is displayed based on search criteria.




---

7. Chat Page

Purpose: Facilitates real-time conversations between matched users.

Features:

Chat List: Displays all users with whom the current user has started a chat.

Chat Section:

A dedicated area for messaging.

Real-time message sending and receiving powered by WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.IO).

Conversation history is fetched from the backend.

Backend Features

The backend of Sparkify is built to handle all the functionalities efficiently and securely. Here's an overview of the main functionalities:

1. Authentication

User Registration:

Backend API to create new user accounts.

Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before storing.


User Login:

Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Middleware to protect routes and verify tokens.




---

2. Swipe Functionality

Backend logic to:

Track user actions (like, dislike) in the Swipe Schema, which includes:

user: The ID of the user performing the action.

actions: An array of objects containing targetUserId and the action taken (e.g., "like" or "dislike").


Check for mutual matches:

When a user likes someone, the system checks if that user has already liked them back. If so, a new match is created in the Matches Schema.


Ensure no duplicate matches:

Logic to prevent forming multiple matches for the same pair.





---

3. User Fetching

API to fetch users on whom no action has been taken by the current user.

Efficient querying using the Swipe schema to exclude profiles that have already been liked or disliked.



---

4. Matches

API to fetch all matched users for the current user.

Matches are stored in the Matches Schema:

Includes user1 and user2 IDs to identify the matched pair.




---

5. Chat Functionality

Chat Schema:

Stores messages between two users.

Fields include senderId, receiverId, message, and timestamp.


APIs for:

Fetching chat lists for the current user.

Fetching conversation history between two users.

Sending new messages and saving them to the database.


WebSocket integration for real-time messaging.



---

6. Profile Management

APIs to:

Fetch user details for the profile page.

Update user information (e.g., bio, preferences).




---

Technology Stack

Frontend:

React (with Vite for fast builds and development).

React Router for client-side navigation.

Context API for state management.

custom CSS for styling.


Backend:

Node.js with Express for API development.

MongoDB with Mongoose for database management.

JWT for authentication.

Socket.IO for real-time chat.


Hosting:

Frontend deployed on Vercel.

Backend deployed on Render.
